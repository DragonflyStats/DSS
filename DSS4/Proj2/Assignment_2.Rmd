## Exploratory Data Analysis - Air Quality Analysis

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.


#### Download the Data
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
fileurl = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip"
download.file(fileurl, "Summary.zip", method = "curl")
unzip(zipfile = "Summary.zip")
unlink("Summary.zip")
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
```

```{r process}
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

NEI <- NEI %>%
  mutate(SCC = factor(SCC),
         year = factor(year))
```

### Plot 1

Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. Upload a PNG file containing your plot addressing this question.

```{r plot1, cache = TRUE}
#Summing emissions by SCC and year
totals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,NEI, sum)
barplot(totals$Emissions, xlab="Year", ylab="PM2.5 Emissions", main = "PM2.5 Emission Totals", names.arg = totals$year)
```

### Plot 2

Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the  Baltimore City, Maryland ( 𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == 𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶) from 1999 to 2008? 
Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

```{r plot2, cache= TRUE}
#Subsetting to baltimore and totalling by year
balt <- NEI[which(NEI$fips == 24510),]
tbal <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,balt, sum)
barplot(tbal$Emissions, xlab="Year", ylab="PM2.5 Emissions", main = "Baltimore PM2.5 Emission Totals", names.arg = tbal$year)
```

### Plot 3
Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

```{r plot3, cache = TRUE}
agg_type_year <- aggregate(NEI$Emissions, list(NEI$type, NEI$year),mean)
g <- ggplot(agg_type_year, aes(y=x, x=Group.2))+geom_point(aes(colour = factor(Group.1)), size = 4)
g+geom_line(aes(group=Group.1,colour=Group.1))
```

### Plot 4

Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

```{r plot4, cache = TRUE}
coal_SCC <- SCC[grep("*coal*|*Coal*",SCC$Short.Name),]$SCC
coal_data <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% coal_SCC,]
suppressWarnings(agg_coal <- aggregate(coal_data, list(coal_data$year), mean))
g2 <- ggplot(agg_coal, aes(x=Group.1, y=Emissions, group =1)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(Group.1)), size = 4)+geom_line()
g2
```

### Plot 5
How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

```{r plot5}
vehicle_SCC <- SCC[grep("*vehicle*|*Vehicle*",SCC$Short.Name),]$SCC
motor_balt <- balt%>% filter(SCC %in% vehicle_SCC)

agg_motor_balt <- aggregate(motor_balt$Emissions, list(motor_balt$year),mean)
g3 <- ggplot(agg_motor_balt, aes(x=Group.1, y=x, group =1)) + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(Group.1)), size = 4)+geom_line()
g3
```

### Plot 6

```{r plot6}
LA <- NEI %>% filter(fips == "06037")
motor_LA <- LA %>% filter(SCC %in% vehicle_SCC)

agg_motor_LA <- aggregate(motor_LA$Emissions, list(motor_LA$year),mean)
agg_motor_LA$city <- rep("LA",4)
agg_motor_balt$city <- rep("Baltimore",4)

two_cities <- rbind.data.frame(agg_motor_balt,agg_motor_LA)

g4 <- ggplot(two_cities, aes(x=factor(Group.1), y=x, group =city)) + geom_point(aes(colour = city), size = 4)+geom_line(aes(colour=city))
g4
```
