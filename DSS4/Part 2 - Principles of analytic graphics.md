Principles of analytic graphics
===============================



#### Principle 1: Show comparisons

Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.

Always ask "Compared to What?"

#### Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure

What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

#### Principle 3: Show multivariate data

- Multivariate = more than 2 variables
- The real world is multivariate
- Need to "escape flatland"


#### Principle 4: Integration of evidence

- Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams

- Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation

- Don't let the tool drive the analysis

#### Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.

A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

#### Principle 6: Content is king

Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
