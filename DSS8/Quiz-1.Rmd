This is Quiz 1 from the Machine Learning course within the Data Science Specialization. This publication is intended as a learning resource, all answers are documented and explained.

Questions

-------------------------------------------
### Question 1

1. Which of the following are components in building a machine learning algorithm?

Creating features

Explanation:
Self-Explanatory

-------------------------------------------
### Question 2

2. Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?

Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.
Explanation:
If your algorithm is too specific to the peculiarities of an individual set, it may lead to false classification and bad predictions.

-------------------------------------------
### Question 3

3. What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.

Explanation:
Self-explanatory

-------------------------------------------
### Question 4

4. What are some common error rates for predicting binary variables (i.e. variables with two possible values like yes/no, disease/normal, clicked/didnâ€™t click)? 
Check the correct answer(s).

Predictive value of a positive
Explanation:
Self-explanatory

-------------------------------------------
### Question 5

5. Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. 
The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?

9%
Explanation:
n <- 1000000
prevalence = 1/1000
sens <- .99
spec <- .99
clicked <- prevalence * n
TP <- sens * clicked
Notclicked <- n - clicked
TN <- spec * Notclicked
FP <- Notclicked * sens
FP<- Notclicked-TN
PPV <- TP/ (TP+FP)
