### Concrete


### Question 
Load the concrete data with the commands:


```{r}
set.seed(3523)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(concrete)
inTrain = createDataPartition(concrete$CompressiveStrength, p = 3/4)[[1]]
training = concrete[ inTrain,]
testing = concrete[-inTrain,]
```

Set the seed to 325 and fit a support vector machine using the e1071 package to predict Compressive Strength using the default settings. 
Predict on the testing set. What is the RMSE?


#### Explanation:
Support Vector machines are a supervised learning classification and regression method

```{r message=FALSE}
set.seed(325)
library(e1071)
```

```{r}
svm <- svm(CompressiveStrength ~ ., data = training)
pred <- predict(svm, testing)
accuracy(pred, testing$CompressiveStrength)
```

#### Answer

6.72
