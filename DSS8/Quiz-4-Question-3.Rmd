### Question 3. 

Load the concrete data with the commands:

```{r}
set.seed(3523)
library(caret)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(concrete)
inTrain = createDataPartition(concrete$CompressiveStrength, p = 3/4)[[1]]
training = concrete[ inTrain,]
testing = concrete[-inTrain,]
```

Set the seed to 233 and fit a lasso model to predict Compressive Strength. 
Which variable is the last coefficient to be set to zero as the penalty increases? (Hint: it may be useful to look up ?plot.enet).


Cement

#### Explanation:
Regularizing the coefficients is like a stepwise approach toward least squares. The enet chart shows which coefficients are the last to go.

```{r}
set.seed(233)
lasso <- train(CompressiveStrength~., method = "lasso", data = training)
## Loading required package: elasticnet

## Loading required package: lars

## Loaded lars 1.2
plot.enet(lasso$finalModel, xvar = "penalty")
```
