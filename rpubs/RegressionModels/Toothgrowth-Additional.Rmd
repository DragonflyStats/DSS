regression}\label{example-1-linear-regression}

\subsubsection{Description of ToothGrowth
dataset}\label{description-of-toothgrowth-dataset}

The ToothGrowth dataset loads with the datasets package.

    The data are from an experiment examining how vitamin C dosage delivered
in 2 different methods predicts tooth growth in guinea pigs.

The data consist of 60 observations, representing 60 guinea pigs, and 3
variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{\emph{len}}: numeric, tooth (odontoblast, actually) length
\item
  \textbf{\emph{supp}}: factor, supplement type, 2 levels, ``VC'' is
  ascorbic acid, and ``OJ'' is orange juice
\item
  \textbf{\emph{dose}}: numeric, dose (mg/day)
\end{itemize}

A quick look at ToothGrowth reveals that many guinea pigs were given the
same dose of vitamin C. Three doses, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, were used. ​

    \subsubsection{Example 1: Exploratory
analysis}\label{example-1-exploratory-analysis}

Graphical exploration of the dataset provides the researcher with
descriptive depictions of summaries of variables or relationship among
variables.

We being our exploration of Toothgrowth by examining the distributions
of supp and dose. Since both variables are discretely distributed, we
want the frequencies (counts) of each value.

Frequencies are often plotted as bars, so we select geom\_bar. We
specify dose mapped to x and supp mapped to the fill color of the bars,
which will give us counts of each dose divided by supp.

\subsubsection{Exploring distributions}\label{exploring-distributions}

    Statistical models often make assumptions about the distribution of the
outcome (or its residuals), so an inspection might be wise. First let's
check the overall distribution of ``len'' with a density plot:

    \begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, size=fbox, boxrule=1pt, pad at break*=1mm,colback=cellbackground, colframe=cellborder]

    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    We can get densities of len by supp by mapping supp to color:

    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    \paragraph{Summarizing the outcome across a
predictor}\label{summarizing-the-outcome-across-a-predictor}

Because dose takes on only 3 values, many point are crowded in 3
columns, obscuring the shape of relationship between dose and len. We
replace the column of points at each dose value with its mean and
confidence limit using stat\_summary instead of geom\_point.

    The outcome distributions appear a bit skewed, but the samples are
small.

\subsubsection{Quick scatterplot of outcome and
predictor}\label{quick-scatterplot-of-outcome-and-predictor}

We plot the dose-tooth length (len) relationship.

    \subsubsection{Interpreting the previous
graph}\label{interpreting-the-previous-graph}

This graph suggests:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The slope of the dose-response curve decreases as dose increases for
  both supp types, suggesting a quadratic function.
\item
  The slope of the OJ curve flattens more dramatically, perhaps
  suggesting the quadratic term is different between supplement groups
\item
  The initial slopes look rather similar, perhaps suggesting that the
  linear term may not be different between groups
\item
  The 2 supp group means differ at the two lower doses, but not at the
  highest dose
\end{enumerate}

ggplot2 makes graphs summarizing the outcome easy ​ We just plotted
means and confidence limits of len, with lines connecting the means,
separated by supp, all without any manipulation to the original data! ​
The stat\_summary function facilitates looking at patterns of means,
just as regression models do. ​ Next we fit our linear regression model
and check model assumptions with diagnostic graphs. ​

    \subsubsection{Model preliminaries}\label{model-preliminaries}

​ We want to model how tooth length (len) is predicted by dose, allowing
for moderation of this relationship through an interaction with supp. ​
We assume that dose and tooth length have a smooth, continuous
relationship in the range of doses tested, so we will treat dose as a
continuous (numeric) predictor. We also create a dose-squared variable,
for use in the quadratic model and prediction later. ​

\end{tcolorbox}

    \subsubsection{Fitting the model}\label{fitting-the-model}

We noticed in the previous graph that the dose-len relationship appears
quadratic, that the quadratic effect may differ between supp groups, but
that the initial linear slope may not be so different. We fit a model to
reflect our expectations:

\end{tabular}


    
    The model appears to conform to our expectations.

    \subsubsection{Example 1: Model
diagnostics}\label{example-1-model-diagnostics}

Statistical inference depends on the assumptions of the regression
model, which we check with diagnostic graphs. Common diagnostics for
linear regression

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  inspect the normality of the residuals
\item
  verify that the residuals show no trends (assumption of linearity) and
  are homoscedastic,
\item
  check for overly influential outliers.
\item
  fortify makes linear regression diagnostics easy
\end{itemize}

    Conveniently, the fortify function takes a lm model object (one among
several classes) and returns a dataset with several estimated diagnostic
variables including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  .hat: leverages(influence)
\item
  .sigma: residual standard deviation when observation dropped from
  model
\item
  .cooksd: Cook's distance
\item
  .fitted: fitted (predicted) values
\item
  .resid: residuals
\item
  .stdresid: standardized residuals
\end{itemize}

We fortify our lm2 object with these diagnostic variables and take a
quick look a the new variables.

    \subsubsection{Normality of residuals: q-q plot and
stat\_qq}\label{normality-of-residuals-q-q-plot-and-statux5fqq}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A q-q plot can assess the assumption that the residuals are normally
  distributed by plotting the standardized residuals (observed z-score)
  against theoretical quantiles of the normal distribution (expected
  z-score if normally distributed).
\item
  stat\_qq creates a qq-plot. The only required aesthetic is sample,
  which we map to the standardized residual variable created by fortify,
  .stdresid.
\item
  A diagonal reference line (intercept=0, slope=1) is added to the plot
  with geom\_abline, representing perfect fit to a normal distribution.
  The normal distribution will appear to be a reasonable fit below.

    \subsubsection{Identifying influential
observations}\label{identifying-influential-observations}

Strongly influential observations can distort regression coefficients.
The most influential datapoints will typically have more extreme
predictor values (leverage), measured by .hat, and large residuals. The
overall influence of an observation on the model is measured by Cook's
D, variable .cooksd.

The Toothgrowth dataset is fairly balanced across doses and supps (20 at
each of 3 doses, 30 at each of 2 supp). Thus, no values are ``extreme'',
so influential observations for this model will be those with large
residuals.

In the following plot: * map .hat to x, .stdresid to y * map .cooksd to
size, making more influential points larger. * label the points in
geom\_text with their row numbers for identification

The dependence of Cook's D on both leverage and residual is apparent in
the plot, with Cook's D rising as we move away from center (larger
residual) and to the right (larger leverage). No point looks too
influential for concern.
