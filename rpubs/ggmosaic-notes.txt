Using the canonical example

library(ggmosaic)

p <- ggplot(data = fly) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(rude_to_recline), fill=do_you_recline)) +
  theme_mosaic()

and then using ggplotly from {plotly}

library(plotly)
ggplotly(p)

we can create an interactive version of the mosaic plot

For the Top left, the tool tip text will read as

	always
	no
	Frequency: 124

Is there a way of customising the tooltip text? similar examples for Barcharts would be along the lines of the code below


p <- ggplot(data = fly) +
  geom_mosaic(aes(x = product(rude_to_recline), fill=do_you_recline,
    text=paste("\n Rude to Recline?:",rude_to_recline,"\nDo you recline?",do_you_recline")
   )) +
  theme_mosaic()


ggplotly(p, tooltip="text")
