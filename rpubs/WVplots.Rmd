WVPlots: Common Plots for Analysis
==============================
Select data analysis plots, under a standardized calling interface implemented on top of 'ggplot2' and 'plotly'. Plots of interest include: 'ROC', gain curve, scatter plot with marginal distributions, conditioned scatter plot with marginal densities, box and stem with matching theoretical distribution, and density with matching theoretical distribution.



```{r}
set.seed(34903490)
x = rnorm(50)
y = 0.5*x^2 + 2*x + rnorm(length(x))
frm = data.frame(
  x = x,
  y = y,
  yC = y>=as.numeric(quantile(y,probs=0.8)),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
frm$absY <- abs(frm$y)
frm$posY = frm$y > 0
```

Scatterplot
=============

Scatterplot with smoothing line through points.

```{r out.width = "100%" }
WVPlots::ScatterHist(frm, "x", "y", title="Example Fit")
```
