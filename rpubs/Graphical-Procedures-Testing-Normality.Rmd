 * The normal probability (Q-Q) plot is a very useful tool for determining whether or not a data set is normally distributed.
 * textbf{Important} Interpretation is simple. If the points follow the trendline, we can assume that that data set is a sample drawn from a normally distributed population.
%(provided by the second line of texttt{R} code texttt{qqline}).
 * One should expect minor deviations. Numerous major deviations would lead the analyst to conclude that the data set is not normally distributed.
 * The Q-Q plot is best used in conjunction with a formal procedure such as the Shapiro-Wilk test.

A normal distribution is often a reasonable model for the data. Without inspecting the data, however, it is risky to assume a normal distribution. There are a number of graphs that can be used to check the deviations of the data from the normal distribution. 

A histogram is an example of a graph that can be used to check normality. Here, the histogram should reveal a bell shaped curve. (IMAGE HERE)

\subsection*{The Q-Q Plot}



The most useful tool for assessing normality is a quantile quantile or QQ plot. This is a scatterplot with the quantiles of the scores on the horizontal axis and the expected normal scores on the vertical axis. The steps in constructing a QQ plot are as follows: First, we sort the data from smallest to largest. A plot of these scores against the expected normal scores should reveal a straight line. The expected normal scores are calculated by taking the z-scores  where I is the rank in increasing order.

Curvature of the points indicates departures of normality. This plot is also useful for detecting outliers. The outliers appear as points that are far away from the overall pattern op points
