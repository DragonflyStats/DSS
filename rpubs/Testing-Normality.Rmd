### Create Some Data

X is intentionally created as a Normally distributed random sample.
Conversely, Y is created as a sample from the exponential distribution.
```{r}
X <- rnorm(1000,100,10)
Y <- rexp(1000,10)
```

#### Histogram of X and Y

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(X,breaks=100)
hist(Y,breaks=100)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```


### The Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality

```{r}
shapiro.test(X)
```

```{r}
shapiro.test(Y)
```


### {nortest}: Tests for Normality

Five omnibus tests for testing the composite hypothesis of norm


```{r}
library(nortest)
```
