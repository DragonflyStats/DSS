The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 
 
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 
Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

 Good luck!

The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:

Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt, the result of which is a 10299x561 data frame, as in the original description ("Number of Instances: 10299" and "Number of Attributes: 561"), train/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt, the result of which is a 10299x1 data frame with subject IDs, and train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt, the result of which is also a 10299x1 data frame with activity IDs.

Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The result is a 10299x66 data frame, because only 66 out of 561 attributes are measurements on the mean and standard deviation. All measurements appear to be floating point numbers in the range (-1, 1).

Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

walking

walkingupstairs

walkingdownstairs

sitting

standing

laying
The script also appropriately labels the data set with descriptive names: all feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted to lower case, underscores and brackets () are removed. Then it merges the 10299x66 data frame containing features with 10299x1 data frames containing activity labels and subject IDs. The result is saved as merged_clean_data.txt, a 10299x68 data frame such that the first column contains subject IDs, the second column activity names, and the last 66 columns are measurements. Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. The names of the attributes are similar to the following:

tbodyacc-mean-x 

tbodyacc-mean-y 

tbodyacc-mean-z 

tbodyacc-std-x 

tbodyacc-std-y 

tbodyacc-std-z 

tgravityacc-mean-x 

tgravityacc-mean-y
Finally, the script creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject. The result is saved as data_set_with_the_averages.txt, a 180x68 data frame, where as before, the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names (see below), and then the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages.
