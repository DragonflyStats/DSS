## Project Overview

This project demonstrates your ability to collect, clean, and prepare a dataset for analysis. The objective is to produce **tidy data** that is suitable for subsequent statistical work. Peer grading is based on a checklist of yes/no questions that assess the completeness and quality of your submission.

### Your submission must include:
1. A tidy dataset as specified in the instructions.
2. A link to a GitHub repository containing:
   - Your R script: `run_analysis.R`
   - A code book: `CodeBook.md`, describing variables, data sources, and transformations.
   - A `README.md`, explaining how your analysis works and how all scripts are connected.

## Background

Wearable computing is a rapidly growing field in data science, with major players such as Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up developing innovative algorithms for health and fitness tracking.

The dataset used in this project comes from accelerometers embedded in the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It contains sensor signals from 30 subjects performing six different activities. More details about the original dataset are available here:  
[UCI HAR Dataset Description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Dataset Download
You can download the dataset using the following link:

## Analysis Script: `run_analysis.R`

This script performs the following steps:

1. **Merges** the training and test datasets into one unified dataset.
   - `X_train.txt` and `X_test.txt` → Combined measurements (561 features × 10,299 observations)
   - `subject_train.txt` and `subject_test.txt` → Combined subject IDs
   - `y_train.txt` and `y_test.txt` → Combined activity labels

2. **Extracts** measurements related to the **mean** and **standard deviation** (66 of 561 features).

3. **Applies descriptive activity names** using `activity_labels.txt`, mapping:
   - *walking*
   - *walking upstairs*
   - *walking downstairs*
   - *sitting*
   - *standing*
   - *laying*

4. **Cleans and labels** the dataset with descriptive variable names:
   - All feature names are converted to lowercase.
   - Special characters such as underscores and parentheses are removed.

5. **Creates a second tidy dataset**:
   - Groups the dataset by subject and activity.
   - Calculates the average of each variable.
   - The result is saved as `data_set_with_the_averages.txt` (180 rows × 68 columns):
     - 30 subjects × 6 activities = 180 observations
     - 66 features + subject + activity = 68 columns

## Attribute Examples

Here are a few examples of cleaned attribute names:

- `tbodyacc-mean-x`  
- `tbodyacc-mean-y`  
- `tbodyacc-std-z`  
- `tgravityacc-mean-x`  

These refer to body acceleration signals and gravitational signals along various axes, with suffixes indicating statistical operations (mean, standard deviation).
