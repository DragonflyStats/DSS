Question 1
Suppose I define the following function in R
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
What is the result of running
cube(3)
in R after defining this function?
The number 27 is returned
A warning is given with no value returned.
An error is returned because 'n' is not specified in the call to 'cube'
The users is prompted to specify the value of 'n'.
Question 2
The following code will produce a warning in R.
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}
Why?
'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.
The expression uses curly braces.
There are no elements in 'x' that are greater than 5
You cannot set 'x' to be 0 because 'x' is a vector and 0 is a scalar.
The syntax of this R expression is incorrect.
Question 3
Consider the following function
f <- function(x) {
        g <- function(y) {
                y + z
        }
        z <- 4
        x + g(x)
}
If I then run in R
z <- 10
f(3)
What value is returned?
7
4
10
16
Question 4
Consider the following expression:
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
        NA
} else {
        10
}
What is the value of 'y' after evaluating this expression?
10
5
3
NA
Question 5
Consider the following R function
h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
        z <- cbind(x, d)
        if(!is.null(y))
                z <- z + y
        else
                z <- z + f
        g <- x + y / z
        if(d == 3L)
                return(g)
        g <- g + 10
        g
}
Which symbol in the above function is a free variable?
f
z
d
L
g
Question 6
What is an environment in R?
a list whose elements are all functions
a collection of symbol/value pairs
a special type of function
an R package that only contains data
Question 7
The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?
compilation scoping
lexical scoping
dynamic scoping
global scoping
Question 8
How are free variables in R functions resolved?
The values of free variables are searched for in the working directory
The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was defined
The values of free variables are searched for in the environment in which the function was called
The values of free variables are searched for in the global environment
Question 9
What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?
All objects can be stored on the disk
R objects cannot be larger than 100 MB
All objects must be stored in memory
Functions cannot be nested
Question 10
In R, what is the parent frame?
It is the environment in which a function was defined
It is always the global environment
It is the environment in which a function was called
It is the package search list
