OO Programming Commands
========================================================
* A generic function is a function that identifies the class of its input and calls an appropriate method.

* Help files are very useful with questions 9 and 10

* The `getMethod()` function is used to obtain the function body for an S4 method function. A call to `getMethod()` returns the method for a particular function and signature.

* The `getClass()` function gets the definition for a class.

* The `showMethods()` function shows a summary of the methods for one or more generic functions, possibly restricted to those involving specified classes.

* The `getS3Method()` function is used to obtain the function body for an S3 method function.

* The `getOldMethod()` function registers an old-style (a.k.a. 'S3') class as a formally defined class. Each of the names will be defined as an S4 class.
