\section{Statistical Inference Quiz 1}


\subsection{Question 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item Consider influenza epidemics for two parent heterosexual families. 
\item Suppose that the probability is 17\% that at least one of the parents has contracted the disease. 
\item The probability that the father has contracted influenza is 12\% while the probability that both the mother and father have contracted the disease is 6\%. 
\item What is the probability that the mother has contracted influenza?
\end{itemize}
Express your answer as a percentage to the nearest percentage point.

% Uniform Distribution
\subsection{Question 2}
A random variable, X is uniform, a box from 0 to 1 of height 1. (So that it's density is $f(x)=1$ for $0\leq x\leq 1$.) 
What is it's 75th percentile?

Express your answer to two decimal places.

\subsection{Question 3}
You are playing a game with a friend where you flip a coin and if it comes up heads you give her X dollars and if it comes up tails she gives you Y dollars. 
The probability that the coin is heads in p (some number between 0 and 1.) 
What has to be true about X and Y to make so that both of your expected total earnings is 0. 
(The game would then be called “fair”.)

\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] p1−p=XY
\item[(ii)] p1−p=YX
\item[(iii)] X=Y
\item[(iv)] p=XY
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 4}
You are playing a game with a friend where you flip a coin and if it comes up heads you give her 1 dollar and 
if it comes up tails she gives you one dollar. What would be the variance of your earnings?

Express your answer to two decimal places.

\subsection{Question 5}
Let X1,…,Xn1 be random variables independent of Y1,…,Yn2, where both groups are iid with associated population means $\mu$1 and $\mu$2 and population variances $\sigma^2_1$ and $\sigma^2_2$, respectively. Let $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ be their sample means. What is the variance of $\bar{X} + \bar{Y}$ ?

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1}+ \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}$
\item $\sigma^2_1−\sigma^2_2$
\item $\sigma^2_1+\sigma^2_2$
\item $\frac{\sigma^2_1}{n_1}- \frac{\sigma^2_2}{n_2}$

\subsection{Question 6}
Suppose a random variable, X, is such that E[X]=$\mu$  and $Var(X)=\sigma^2$. 
What is the mean and variance of $Z= \frac{X−\mu}{\sigma}$

\begin{itemize}
\item Z has mean 0 and variance 1
\item Z has mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$
\item Z has mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$
\item Z has mean $\mu$ and variance 1

\subsection{Question 7}
If a continuous density that never touches the horizontal axis is symmetric about zero, can we say that its associated median is zero?

\begin{itemize}
\item We can't conclude that the median is 0.
\item Yes, the median must be 0.
\item No, the median is definitely not 0.

\subsubsection*{Expected Value for Discrete Random Variables}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The expected value (i.e. the mean) of a discrete random variable $X$ is symbolized by E(X).
	
	\item If X is a discrete random variable with possible values $\{ x_1, x_2, x_3,\ldots , x_n\}$, and $p(x_i)$ denotes $P(X = x_i)$, then the expected value of $X$ is defined by:
	{
		\Large
	\[
	E(X) = \sum x_i \times p(x_i)
	\]
}
	where the elements are summed over all values of the random variable $X$.
